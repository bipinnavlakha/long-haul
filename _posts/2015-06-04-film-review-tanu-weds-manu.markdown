Today i watched the movie "Tanu Weds Manu Returns". I haven't watched the first part of the movie(though i now feel i should watch it). If you are also like me and haven't yet watched the first part don't worry the current one  does not borrow much from the earlier one except for the character introductions and the fact that the first one ends with Tanu marrying Manu.

Well i will try to review the different aspects of the movie:-

- **Plot Summary**:- Tanu and Manu start having marital problems after 4 years of their marriage. Tanu dumps Manu into a mental asylum and returns back to Kanpur. Meanwhile Manu also returns back to India and finds love in a look alike of Tanu - Kusum. Manu and Kusum decide to get married. Will this marriage happen or will Tanu and Manu get back together is what unfolds ahead.

- **Story**:- Well this is the most important part of the movie for me. I would say the story is so-so. The ending turns out to be predictable. This I think is the weak link of the movie

- **Acting**:- Kangana Ranaut steals the show here. Here double role as Kusum/Tanu was one of the best i have seen in a Bollywood movie. The two roles seem poles apart and justice was done to both of them. Kangana Ranaut shall definitely be a strong contender for many movie awards next year. Besides kangana Madhavan and Deepak Dobriyal have done justice to their roles.

- **Cinematography**:- The parts of Kanpur(Tanu's hometown are shot beautifully). Wouldn't say the same for Delhi. A part where Tanu walks lonely in a village in Haryana has been shot beautifully capturing various elements lurking in a village post nightfall.

- **Editing**:- The editing was crisp overall except for the parts where Tanu and Kusum come face to face. I am unaware of the technique used to have the two characters come face to face but it surely didn't look real on screen.

- **Dialogues**:- This is a strong point of the movie. This haryanvi is well written and is surprisingly completely understandable. Credit should also be given to Kangana for getting the accent right.

- **Sound and Background Score**:- Except for the track Banno personally didnt like any of the tracks though ymmv

- **Sets**:- Well i did not like this part. None of the sets i.e. Tanu/Mann/Kusumâ€™s homes weren't properly designed according to the locale.

- **Costumes**:- The costumes for Kusum especially the ones used for her marriage seem good and authentic.

- **Target Audience**:- It is a family entertainer. Definitely a one time watch for anyone

- **My rating:- 3.5/5**
